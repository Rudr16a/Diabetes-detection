## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management of diabetes can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals. This project leverages machine learning to predict diabetes using medical data, helping in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementations of various models including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machine.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Prediction**: Classify new input data to predict the likelihood of diabetes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Google Colab account
- Basic knowledge of machine learning

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-detection.git
   cd diabetes-detection
   ```

2. Open the project in Google Colab:

   - Upload the `diabetes_detection.ipynb` notebook to your Google Drive.
   - Open the notebook in Google Colab.

3. Install required dependencies:

   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**: Load the dataset and preprocess the data (handling missing values, normalization).

2. **Train the Model**: Train the model using the preprocessed data.

3. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.

4. **Make Predictions**: Use the trained model to classify new input data.

Detailed instructions for each step are provided in the `diabetes_detection.ipynb` notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It contains 768 instances of medical data with 8 features, including:

- Number of pregnancies
- Plasma glucose concentration
- Diastolic blood pressure
- Triceps skin fold thickness
- 2-Hour serum insulin
- Body mass index (BMI)
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Age

## Model Architecture

The project implements several machine learning models for classification:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forests**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each model is evaluated to determine the best performing one for this classification task.

## Results

The models achieve high accuracy in predicting diabetes. Detailed results, including training and validation accuracy/loss plots and evaluation metrics, are provided in the notebook.
